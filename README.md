# CRANQ Resources Centre

CRANQ is an IDE with integrated repository, designed for building in a visual programming paradigm.  CRANQ code can be made a lot faster, and with fewer bugs than text code.  CRANQ's visual programming paradigm means that junior coders can be onboarded faster, and conversations with non-technical stakeholders are fuller and clearer. &#x20;
