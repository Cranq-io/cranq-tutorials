# CRANQ 101

## First steps - From "Hello World" to "List iterator"

### Step 1 - "Hello World"

Objective:  We're going to write "Hello World" to the console using CRANQ.  PS You should already have installed CRANQ.

New concepts:

* connecting nodes
* running the app
* checking the output
* deleting a connection
* inserting a new node from search
* setting descriptive node names
* storing/reading static values in/from \[Store] nodes
* logging data to the output

### Step 2 - Concatenate strings

Objective: Append "!" to "Hello World" using a Concatenator node.

New concepts:

* moving nodes
* moving the canvas
* showing/hiding inspector panel
* using the \[Concatenator] node
* connecting nodes (input to output this time)

### Step 3 - Chain transformations

Objective: Handling multiple values and chaining multiple transformations

New concepts:

* chaining multiple transformations
* providing start signal to every node (direct or indirect)

### Step 4 - Create a reusable custom node

Objective: Wrap multi-step transformation into a reusable Structure node

New concepts:

* deleting nodes
* creating new structure node
* setting the name of the new node and its prototype
* creating and name input and output ports
* entering and exiting a structure node
* connecting nodes to their parents input/output ports

### Step 5 - Reuse custom node

Objective: Reuse the created custom node with different parameters

New concepts:

* same output can be input of multiple nodes
* adding a custom node via Search (using prototype name)

### Step 6 - Get parameters from a list and iterate

Objective: Replace multiple parameters by an array, and iterate through that array

New concepts:

* using the store the hold a list value
* iterating through a list
* debugging signals with \[Data logger]
* synchronizing list iteration with a static input
