# üëç Getting Started With CRANQ

## Lesson 1: Your First CRANQ App

You're going to be amazed how quickly you can be up and running on CRANQ, even if you have absolutely no prior coding experience.  Let's start with the CRANQ canvas, how to add nodes, and connect them.  We're also going to access an open Yahoo Finance API.

## Lesson 2: Processing Data and Grouping Nodes

You've successfully accessed an API and retrieved the ETH exchange rate.  Now it's time to make a currency converter, and group CRANQ nodes into logical processes.
