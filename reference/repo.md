# Repo

The centerpiece of CRANQ's innovation is the _Repo_: it takes the gobal database of editable code of [GitHub](https://github.com), the universal reusability of [npm](http://npmjs.com) packages, and the ease of use of [Zapier](https://zapier.com) connectors, and blends them into an global, extensible component library that is accessible right from the CRANQ app.

:wrench: Unlike _GitHub_, the code you find in the CRANQ repo can be put to use right away. The Repo is integrated into the IDE, and all CRANQ components share a common makeup of interface and internal structure. This allows you to just drag-and-drop anything from the Repo right into your program.

:wrench: Unlike code on _GitHub_, CRANQ code is an _actual database_ - the representations of hierarchical dataflow graphs - and thus, is a much richer medium than text code for expressing what components are expected to do.

:wrench: Unlike _npm_, the CRANQ repo hosts individual components instead of packages of components. Your running CRANQ program will only contain code that it actually uses.

:wrench: Unlike _npm_ packages, CRANQ components are editable in place.

Unlike _Zapier_, the CRANQ repo is extensible without limit. Building new API integrations, data transformations, and webhooks are all possible without ever stepping outside CRANQ.

Unlike _Zapier_ triggers, apps, and actions, CRANQ components are editable with sophisticated version control.

The CRANQ repo aspires to be the place where all future code will be stored and accessed with ease.
