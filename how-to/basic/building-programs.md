# Building programs

When you code in CRANQ you usually follow the pattern below.

1. Find suitable components in the repo
2. Drag components from the repo to the canvas
3. Connect components on the canvas
4. Group related nodes
5. Optionally, make the group reusable.

Alternatively, you can start by creating a blank node (right click on canvas -> "Add node" -> "New Structure Node"), but it's rarely needed.
