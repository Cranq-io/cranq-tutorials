# Finding nodes

Finding components in the repo currently requires you to search for them by (parts of) their name, namespace, description, and keywords.

Results will be ordered by:

1. whether they're featured by CRANQ
2. whether they are well documented (description filled out, icon assigned, etc.)
3. whether the search term(s) appear in the name, keywords, or description
