# Using version control

Currently the repo is stored as a set of files - one JSON for each node prototype. This comes with a number of advantages, the best of them being that CRANQ code can fit into existing software development workflows. You can use your usual version control system, eg. [Git](https://git-scm.com/), while still treating the repo as a singular database by CRANQ internally.

:wrench: Because version control is very important to any software development work, and the cloud-based repository does not yet exist, CRANQ supports mapping multiple paths in the file system to [custom namespaces](../../course/how-to/mapping-paths-to-namespaces.md). This offers an easy and transparent way to blend public and private domains of CRANQ code into a single, extended repository.
