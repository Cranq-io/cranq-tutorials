# ðŸ“ˆ Using AirTable w/ CRANQ

## Project Overview

This project is going to help you master some fundamental skills in CRANQ!  We're going to pull data from the Yahoo Finance API, and insert it into AirTable, all with low-code.  Then we're going to map that data, and continuously update it, so we could make a trading alert, for example.  Along the way, we'll also work on using variables and buffers.  \
\
You will learn:

1. How to collect data from an open API
2. Data Transformation using CRANQ
3. How to write data to an AirTable
4. How to update an AirTable

Have fun!
