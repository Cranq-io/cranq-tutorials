# ↕ Wrapping Your CRANQ Code in a REST API

This course uses the code created in [Data Manipulation Part 1](../building-cranq-skills-no-experience-required/data-manipulation.md) as a starting point, but is intended as an instruction manual for wrapping any kind of CRANQ code in an API. &#x20;

## REST API (1/2):  A Read-Only API

Dan walks you through the steps of exposing read-only backend logic through a REST API endpoint.

## Lesson 2:  Now, Let's Make this into a Read / Write API

In this lesson you’ll learn about creating endpoints that change data on the backend. Beyond that, this video introduces the concept of shared resources in CRANQ, and a really useful node - the “depot” - which helps you control the order in which signals are transmitted.
