# ðŸ¤– A Telegram Bot in 15 Minutes

This video guides you through your first steps to build a Telegram bot using free low-code on CRANQ.

Youâ€™ll learn how to:

* build a Telegram bot
* register a webhook for it
* and then get it to echo any message it receives, all without writing a single line of code.

Once you've built your bot, you can build more functionality into it using CRANQ (e.g. adding chatGPT), or simply program various responses.
