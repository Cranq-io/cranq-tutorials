# Less than tester

[number]

Checks if the value received via `value` is less than the value received via `reference`. If the values are equal, it outputs false.

Example:

1. 19@0 is received via `value`
2. 23@0 is received via `reference`
3. true@0 is sent via `less`

### Input ports:

* __value__: `number`
    The first operand of the comparison



* __reference__: `number`
    The second operand of the comparison



### Output ports:

* __less__: `boolean`
    Sends true if 'a' is less than 'b'.
