# ðŸ’¸ Send ETH to a List of Addresses

In this coding tutorial, we will start with a simple list of addresses, and build an app to send ETH out sequentially to each of them, using free CRANQ Low-Code.

First we will turn the list into an array, then iterate through it. We will store our private key and other variables in an Environment Variables Getter and then credentialise each transaction.

You will learn how to:

* Manipulate data
* Iterate through a list
* Store private Environment variables
* Use the ETH transfer node
