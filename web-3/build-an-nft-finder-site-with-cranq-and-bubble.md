# üîç Build an NFT Finder Site with CRANQ and Bubble

We will create a powerful NFT Finder site for the Ethereum chain using No-Code in CRANQ and Bubble. No prior coding experience is required, and all the tools used are free.

First, we will use CRANQ to access an NFTPort API with no-code, and then we will expose that as a CRANQ API using no-code. Then, we will create a minimal UI front end in bubble.io, so that you can access the CRANQ API and search for NFTs based on title and description.

You will learn how to:

* Access an API using CRANQ
* Manipulate data with error handling
* Wrap your code as an API
* Test your API using ngrok and RESTED
* Build a front-end for your API

You will use the following resources:&#x20;

[CRANQ](https://cranq.io)\
[Bubble](https://bubble.io)\
Free [read only sample](https://bubble.io/page?id=nft-search-sample\&tab=tabs-1) of this project\
[NGROK](https://ngrok.com/)\
