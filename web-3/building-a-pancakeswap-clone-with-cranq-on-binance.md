# ðŸ¥ž Building a PancakeSwap Clone with CRANQ on BINANCE

## Summary and Outline

Ever wondered what it would be like to deploy your own DEX on BNB?  It's time to get hands-on experience with Web3 No-Code development by deploying a cloned decentralized exchange (DEX) to a Binance test net, and building a basic UI for it.

This free, and comprehensive course will comprise:

**Part 1**: Deploy a Pancake clone to the Binance testnet

**Part 2**: Fill your DEX clone with test liquidity, deploy test tokens and populate pools using only No-Code tools&#x20;

**Part 3**: We will build a minimalistic UI to interact with the contracts in a classic Web2 way. Also shows using local chain tools to enable infinite testing&#x20;

**Part 4**: Presents interaction with the deployed contracts in a No-Code Web3 way. We traverse the connected smart contracts using queries from within CRANQ.

Ready to start?

## Part 1:  Deploy the Clone

In this video, you will learn:

* How to build a CRANQ No-Code application that deploys a decentralized exchange clone to the Binance test net
* The main components used in a base Pancake / Uniswap DEX
* Good practice in credential handling using CRANQ
* How to reduce work by capturing similarities between complex nodes
* How you can use CRANQ and a blockchain explorer side-by-side to follow the deployment process in real time
* Best practice for deploying dependent contracts, and spotting where errors may happen

## Part 2:   Test liquidity, and funding pools

In this video, we'll do some testing etc.:

* Extending deployment with high level nodes that create test tokens
* Populates the DEX with sample token pair pools
* Creating initialization data using elementary CRANQ nodes
* Shows how hierarchical logic is organized in CRANQ

## Part 3:  Use the DEX via Web2 UI, and test on local node



In this video you will:

* Download a minimalistic Web2 UI, based on a popular framework
* Configure and run it on Binance test chain
* Make some test token trades using a browser wallet plugin
* Install and configure a local test chain to avoid faucet limitation
* Set up the wallet to work with the local node, add local accounts and configure it to see the created local test assets.
* Configure the Cranq app and UI to use the local chain and the deployed local router
