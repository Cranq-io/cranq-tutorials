# Using external npm packages

NB: Most of the cases can be handled with a structure node. Please try to avoid creating new code nodes if possible.
NPM external packages can be used in code nodes.
Lets create a code node. Right click “Add node” and bottom left  “New Code Node”
Add an input and an output port.
Click to the middle of the node, and on the right side panel with title “Node” choose the “code” tab. 
On the tab there is a dependencies field, where you can add external npm packages, one per line.
When the project start this will be installed before the execution.
