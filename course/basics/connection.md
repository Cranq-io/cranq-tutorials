# Connection

A connection transmits [signals](signal.md) from an output port to the connected input port. It also propagates the [parameter](parameter.md) set on a parent node's input port to input ports of connected child nodes.

{% hint style="info" %}
Traffic flowing through connections [can be observed](../../how-to/basic/observing-traffic.md) by right clicking on the connection and selecting "Show traffic".
{% endhint %}
