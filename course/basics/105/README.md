# 105: Composition

When you code in CRANQ you usually follow the pattern below.

1. Find suitable components in the repo
2. Drag components from the repo to the canvas
3. Connect components on the canvas
4. Group related nodes

Finding components in the repo currently requires you to search for them by (parts of) their name, namespace, description, and keywords.

:information\_source: In the future, finding components you actually _need_ will become much easier, faster, and more intuitive with the introduction of the cloud-based repo and the recommendation engine built on top of it.

While dragging components on the canvas doesn't require much [explanation](../102/), connecting components might get tricky when dealing with _iteration_, _aggregation_, and _routing_.

:bulb: Iteration includes all cases where we go through each item in a list or set of some sort, in order to do something with the individual items.
