# 104: Composition

When you code in CRANQ you usually follow the pattern below.

1. Find suitable components in the repo
2. Drag components from the repo to the canvas
3. Connect components on the canvas
4. Group related nodes
5. Optionally, make the group reusable.

Alternatively, you can start by creating a blank node (right click on canvas -> "Add node" -> "New Structure Node"), but it's rarely needed.

## Search

Finding components in the repo currently requires you to search for them by (parts of) their name, namespace, description, and keywords.

Results will be ordered by:

1. whether they're featured by CRANQ
2. whether they are well documented (description filled out, icon assigned, etc.)
3. whether the search term(s) appear in the name, keywords, or description

## Making connections

While dragging components on the canvas doesn't require much [explanation](102/), connecting components might get tricky when dealing with _iteration_ and _aggregation_.

:bulb: During iteration we break down lists or sets and send out each item as an individual signal. Aggregation is the opposite: we receive multiple signals, collect them, and send the result as a signle signal.

Not all pairs of output-input ports can be connected meaningfully. Connecting ports of incompatible data types (eg. the output sends a `string` but the input expects a record), or when the input's expectation about the signal's tag is not satisfied (eg. trying so sync an item from an iteration with the original list).

In most cases though, such as communicating with an API endpoint, we needn't worry about this.

## Grouping

The process of grouping is fairly straightforward: select the nodes you want to group (Cmd / Ctrl + click), open the context menu on one of the selected nodes (right click), then pick "Group nodes". That's it.

However, the way you group makes all the difference, as this is what imposes structure on code. _Well structured CRANQ code is easy to understand and navigate._

Grouping well is not hard at all. If you stick to these best practices, you'll be acing CRANQ:

* Nodes should ideally contain no more than 7 children.\
  This helps keeping the mental load as low as possible_._ No one wants to look at a graph that's tangled beyond understanding.
* Group nodes that together achieve something that you can name. \
  Being able to name a collection of nodes is a good indication that the grouping is justified. If you can't give it a name, try grouping differently.
* Give children names that make out sequences of changes when read along connections. Understanding a graph is easier when you can tell what's happening by just following the connections.

## Reusable nodes

As important as good grouping is, documenting nodes is perhaps even more important, if you want your new node to be easily re-usable by yourself in the future or, be used by others. Well documented nodes are much easier to find in the repo.

If you want to make a node reusable, first you need to flip the switch on the node's prototype panel.&#x20;

From this point on, the node is discoverable in the repo as a _prototype_.

* Give the prototype a name that describes what it does as concisely as possible.
* Place it in a namespace that makes sense. It's a good idea to check whether namespace you have in mind exists, and if it does, what's in it.
* Write a description for the node, expanding on what it does in a bit more detail than the name. Add examples and links to the description if possible.
* Assign an icon to the prototype that reflects its purpose, or makes an external service or API recognizable.
* Clean up ports and (re)name them meaningfully. During grouping, sometimes you get duplicated ports from multiple connections going to the same port in the parent.
* Assign data types to the ports. For the time being these data types are just for documentation, but we're working hard towards types being a basis for determining connections' validity, as well as properties to search nodes by. Data types will become very important in the near future.

If you do the above, your brand new reusable node will be easy to find and easy to work with.
