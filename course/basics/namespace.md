# Namespace

Since the CRANQ repo is the _one_ place for storing CRANQ code, and components are made to be reusable individually, it makes sense to organize them into a hierarchy of _namespaces_.

{% hint style="info" %}
You can have your own namespace, eg. `#mycorp`, co-existing with the public repository, by [mapping](../../how-to/advanced/mapping-paths-to-namespaces.md) your own namespace to a folder path.
{% endhint %}
