# 101: What is CRANQ?

The official answer to this question is that **"CRANQ is a low-code development
platform with a visual,
nodes-and-arrows [IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment)"**
.

However, since CRANQ has this unique quality of uniting the spectrum that lies
between [no-code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-code_development_platform) to
professional coding, CRANQ may bee looked at very differently depending on where
in this spectrum you're standing.

## What is CRANQ to a no-coder?

If you're familiar with workflow automation platforms
like [Zapier](https://zapier.com/),
[Integromat](https://www.integromat.com/en), or [N8N](https://n8n.io/), then the
best way to put it would be that **"CRANQ is an infinitely extensible Zapier"**.

After all, you can build workflows in CRANQ out of high-level nodes representing
popular services such as Airtable, or Google Maps, but the range of connectors
extends beyond what the developer of the platform provides. You can build your
own without leaving CRANQ.
