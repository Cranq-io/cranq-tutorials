# ‚ùì FAQ

## Can I import and view my existing codebase?

**No.** CRANQ code can be visualized as a graph, because it's built as a graph. JavaScript, Python, etc code is not.

:wrench: You can, however, [wrap npm modules](how-to/advanced/wrapping-sdks.md) into nodes. Many integrations in the repo (eg. [Express](https://expressjs.com/)) are already build that way.
