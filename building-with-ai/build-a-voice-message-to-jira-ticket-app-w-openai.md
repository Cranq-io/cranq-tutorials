# ðŸ—£ Build a Voice-Message-to-JIRA-Ticket App w/ OpenAI

This tutorial will explain how to capture a VM through WhatsApp, then use Azure Voice-to-Text, and the OpenAI API to translate conversational text into an actionable JIRA ticket.  Your team will be able to send VMs to a WhatsApp contact, and through the magic of OpenAI, see those cursive thoughts turned into actionable tickets.\
