# ðŸ¦œ Build an AI-Powered WhatsApp Voice Messaging Bot

We will use the WhatsApp API, Azure Speech, and the chatGPT / OpenAI API to build a powerful AI chatbot that you can VM from Whatsapp, and receive an AI voice response. Amaze your friends, and the world, with this cool project, and at the same time build your CRANQ low-code skills.

We will do all this without writing a single line of code, simply dragging and dropping within CRANQ (although you will have to sign up for the relevant APIs). Along the way, we will experiment with talking to OpenAIâ€™s GPT3 models, recognizing your voice and also making some virtual actors to read texts for you.
