# 👨🏫 Prompt chatGPT to return structured data

Ready to take your OpenAI prompt engineering to the next level?  In this code-along, we'll learn how to make API call prompts that consistently return parse-able responses. If you want chatGPT to return data that can easily be used for subsequent data processing, and integration into larger applications, then this next video is for you.

You will learn how to:

* Make engineered calls to the OpenAI API
* Structure your calls to generate parse-able data such as tables
* Extract data from the API output and use OpenAI's API within larger applications
