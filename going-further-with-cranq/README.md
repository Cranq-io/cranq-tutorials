# ðŸ’ª Building with AI

In these projects, we're going to use CRANQ's OpenAI nodes to deliver surprising functionality by integrating them with diffent APIs like JIRA and Azure text-to-voice.  We're going to use AI for various purposes, and go deep on prompt engineering.  Soon, you'll be building your own AI experiments, so have fun!&#x20;
